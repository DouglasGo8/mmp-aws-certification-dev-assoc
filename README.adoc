IMPORTANT: *_Why we need Cloud?_*

- Considering an Online Shop App, with peak load during a black friday, but you have less load out this time, this
mean waste resources in idle loads, company bought infrastructure to wait that such load, and the company falls in
1. Low infrastructure utilization
2. Needs ahead of time planning
3. High costs of procuring infrastructure
4. Dedicated infrastructure maintenance team

- With the Cloud you buy (renting just needed Resources), and release it when not need them,
On-demand resource provisioning offer low costs (pay per use)
- No upfront planning needed
- Avoiding "Undifferentiated heavy lifting"
- AWS provides most of 200+ services

ephemeral volumes, but we can attach permanent storages on them
* Goal -> Set up a EC2 instance with IP Public call Quarkus/Camel Simple Api responding Hello World from my EC2 Host Name
