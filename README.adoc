= AWS Certification - Developer Associate 2021

[.lead]

*_This course includes Quarkus v2.x, Apache Camel Quarkus v2.x and Terraform v1.x with all challenge details
founded over the Course_*

IMPORTANT: *_Why we need Cloud?_*

- Considering an Online Shop App, with peak load during a black friday, but you have less load out this time, this
mean waste resources in idle loads, company bought infrastructure to wait that such load, and the company falls in
1. Low infrastructure utilization
2. Needs ahead of time planning
3. High costs of procuring infrastructure
4. Dedicated infrastructure maintenance team

[.lead]

- With the Cloud you buy (renting just needed Resources), and release it when not need them,
On-demand resource provisioning offer low costs (pay per use)
- No upfront planning needed
- Avoiding "Undifferentiated heavy lifting"
- AWS provides most of 200+ services

== IAM Section

1. Root User -> IAM User in a group with permissions
2. Never ever use Root User to create or manage resources
3. As Root user type go to IAM console search and create a group and after the user, *_e.g. DevGroup_* and their
policies -> *_e.g. DevUser_*, assign it to a  group, provides *_Programmatic access & AWS Management Console Access_*

== Regions and Zones

1. AWS provides multiple zones classified as regions (20+) that means multiple data centers spread around the world
us-east-1 is the most common region used, in general choose that region based on your users and data are located,
with regulatory and security compliance needs

== EC2 Fundamentals

* EC2 Elastic Computer Cloud, represents rented virtual servers, virtual machines billed by second
* We can create and manage EC2 lifecycle of EC2 instances create load balancers and auto scaling groups, EC2 have
ephemeral volumes, but we can attach permanent storages on them
 1. Goal -> Set up a EC2 Ubuntu instance with IP Public call Quarkus/Camel in Native Mode Simple Api responding Hello World from my EC2 Host Name over 80 port, copy this native file generated by GRAAL_VM to this machine and access public the API, everything will be created using terraform,
 2. Goal -> Set up a EC2 Amazon Image and access it by ssh
 3. Goal -> Must to specify the Volume Type and Volume Size in terraform ec2 resource
 4. Goal -> Must specify tags
* Security groups acting as a virtual firewall
* Public Key pair to ssh access must be configured using *_ssh-keygen_*

Further Tasks

* Jar with terraform Provisioners
https://github.com/josefmayer/aws-ec2-java-terraform/blob/master/main.tf[AWS EC2 with api Jar]

* AMI Amazon Machine Image - Free Tear only is a good to tests

* Change the instance type according requirements, instance types are classified are:
 - General purpose starting with t2
 - Compute Optimized starting with c5 - better to heavy cpu workloads
 - GPU Instances staring with g4
 - Memory optimized staring with r5 - better to heavy memory workloads
 - Storage optimized starting with (d2,i2) - better to heavy size
